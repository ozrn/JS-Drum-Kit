# JS-Drum-Kit
This is the first project of JS30 by Wes Bos.<br><br>
In this project, when you hit the corresponding key on your keyboard, it will do two things:<br><br>
* It will play the sound that's associated with that key<br>
* It will do short little animation where it pops the button up to be bigger than we want and also apply yellow border<br><br>
